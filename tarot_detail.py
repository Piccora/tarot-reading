question_2 = "[2] How will my love life in general in the next 6 months is going to go?"
question_3 = "[3] How is my job prospect in the next few years?"
instructions_2 = "Then, think about the question that you just chose very carefully. \nShuffle the tarot deck and then fan it out in a fan shape, similar to playing poker. \nChoose three cards from the cards that you just fanned out. \nLet your heart decides the cards to choose. \nAfter choosing each card, put them separate from the pile of cards, but DO NOT change the order of the cards that you just picked. \nThis is very important for an accurate tarot reading."
